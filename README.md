# Login Page

This project is a simple login page with email and password validation. The login form includes input fields for email and password, and it uses client-side validation to ensure the email is in the correct format and the password meets the minimum length requirement. Upon successful submission, the data is sent to an API, and the user receives a login successful notification before being redirected to a new page.
